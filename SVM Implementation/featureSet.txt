At the edge of our reservation settlement there lived an old man whose arm was twisted up winglike along his side, and who was for that reason named for a butterfly—Shamengwa. Other than his arm, he was an extremely well-made person. Anyone could see that he had been handsome, and he still cut a graceful figure, slim and of medium height. His head was covered with a startling thick mane of white hair, which he was proud of. Every few weeks, he had it carefully trimmed and styled by his daughter, Geraldine, who traveled in from the bush just to do it.

Shamengwa was a man of refinement, who prepared himself carefully to meet life every day. In the Ojibwa language that is spoken on our reservation, owehzhee is the way men get themselves up—pluck stray hairs, brush each tooth, make a precise part in their hair, and, these days, press a sharp crease down the front of their blue jeans—in order to show that, although the government has tried in every way possible to destroy their manhood, they are undefeatable. Owehzhee. We still look good and we know it. The old man was never seen in disarray, and yet there was more to it.

He played the fiddle. How he played the fiddle! Although his arm was so twisted and disfigured that his shirts had to be carefully altered and pinned to accommodate the gnarled shape, he had agility in that arm, even strength. Ever since he was very young, Shamengwa had, with the aid of a white silk scarf, tied his elbow into a position that allowed the elegant hand and fingers at the end of the damaged arm full play across the fiddle’s strings. With his other hand, he drew the bow. When I try to explain the sound he made, I come to some trouble with words. Inside became outside when Shamengwa played music. Yet inside to outside does not half sum it up. The music was more than music—at least, more than what we are used to hearing. The sound connected instantly with something deep and joyous. Those powerful moments of true knowledge which we paper over with daily life. The music tapped our terrors, too. Things we’d lived through and wanted never to repeat. Shredded imaginings, unadmitted longings, fear, and also surprising pleasures. We can’t live at that pitch. But every so often something shatters like ice, and we fall into the river of our own existence. We are aware. This realization was in his music somehow, or in the way Shamengwa played it.

Thus Shamengwa wasn’t wanted at every party. The wild joy his jigs and reels brought forth might just as easily send people crashing onto the rocks of their roughest memories and they’d end up stunned and addled or crying in their beer. So it is. People’s emotions often turn on them. Geraldine, a dedicated, headstrong woman who six years back had borne a baby, dumped its father, and earned a degree in education, sometimes drove Shamengwa to fiddling contests, where he could perform in more of a concert setting. He even won awards, prizes of the cheap sort given at local musical contests—engraved plaques and small tin cups set on plastic pedestals. These he placed on a triangular scrap of shelf high in one corner of his house. The awards were never dusted, and sometimes, when his grandchild asked him to take them down for her to play with, they came apart. Shamengwa didn’t care. He was, however, fanatical about his violin.

He treated this instrument with the reverence we accord our drums, which are considered living beings and require from us food, water, shelter, and love. He fussed over it, stroked it clean with a soft cotton handkerchief, laid it carefully away in the cupboard every night in a leather case that he kept as well polished as his shoes.

We talk about cousins like these for a while, but we go on finally to people we knew more intimately, people whose characters have left us, even after all these years, something to wonder about. We speculate on how and when Robert Allard began taking morphine, and what induced Maggie McLean to turn Jim Crenfew down for a nincompoop1 like Edward Brewer. Somebody has seen the notice of Maggie’s death in a New Orleans paper. We think of it, but we cannot take it in. We see her as she was when she first came to Merry Point to visit, a frail, high-spirited girl, who made us all indignant with her outrageous treatment of Jim Crenfew. We talk on like that until we have called to mind almost all the people who ever came here in the old days. We hold them in our minds until they seem to live again. I look up through the branches of the sugar tree to where a light burns dimly in one of the upstairs rooms. Girls might be dressing there for a party. At any moment, I may hear the rumbling, explosive laugh of Jim Crenfew.

At such a time, none of us three will stop talking. We keep up the illusion, with a name here, a name there. Seeking to make the scene more complete, we cast about on the fringes of our enormous family connection. What ever became of this cousin, or how was that person connected? It is then that Tom Rivers’s name will be mentioned. Infrequently, I say. One or two summers will go by, and I may not hear his name. And then it will be spoken, and I have always that start, half pleasure, half pride, and I realize that no matter whether I hear his name or not he is never out of my memory.

There is a curious thing I have observed. If you sit day after day, summer after summer, in a chair under the same tree, you will notice how the light falls under and through the boughs to strike always in the same pattern. You notice how it falls that way year after year, changing only with the seasons, and you think how you might go away and suffer death or torture by fire or flood, and the light always at the same hour in that season will be creeping around the bole2 of that beech tree.

It is like that with me when I think about Tom Rivers. I cannot understand how it was that he disappeared, leaving nowhere any trace of his going. I sit here in the late afternoon, and the long lances of shadow start from the garden fence and move slowly on, past the big sugar tree and past the beech tree, to halt for a moment at the little sugar tree that stands not fifty yards from my chair.

When they have moved past, I see that the hunched, dark shadow that seemed to me a rooster standing with his back to the western light is really only a clump of dog fennel. I see it happen like that almost every afternoon, and with it comes always a fresh wonder at the restless, hurried movements of human beings. The light can fall like that evening after evening on some tree or flower, and yet a man that one has known intimately can vanish, as we always say of Tom Rivers, off the face of the earth.

I see it happen like that almost every afternoon, and with it comes always a fresh wonder at the restless, hurried movements of human beings. The light can fall like that evening after evening on some tree or flower, and yet a man that one has known intimately can vanish, as we always say of Tom Rivers, off the face of the earth.

We talk about cousins like these for a while, but we go on finally to people we knew more intimately, people whose characters have left us, even after all these years, something to wonder about. We speculate on how and when Robert Allard began taking morphine, and what induced Maggie McLean to turn Jim Crenfew down for a nincompoop1 like Edward Brewer. Somebody has seen the notice of Maggie’s death in a New Orleans paper. We think of it, but we cannot take it in. We see her as she was when she first came to Merry Point to visit, a frail, high-spirited girl, who made us all indignant with her outrageous treatment of Jim Crenfew. We talk on like that until we have called to mind almost all the people who ever came here in the old days. We hold them in our minds until they seem to live again. I look up through the branches of the sugar tree to where a light burns dimly in one of the upstairs rooms. Girls might be dressing there for a party. At any moment, I may hear the rumbling, explosive laugh of Jim Crenfew.

At such a time, none of us three will stop talking. We keep up the illusion, with a name here, a name there. Seeking to make the scene more complete, we cast about on the fringes of our enormous family connection. What ever became of this cousin, or how was that person connected? It is then that Tom Rivers’s name will be mentioned. Infrequently, I say. One or two summers will go by, and I may not hear his name. And then it will be spoken, and I have always that start, half pleasure, half pride, and I realize that no matter whether I hear his name or not he is never out of my memory.

There is a curious thing I have observed. If you sit day after day, summer after summer, in a chair under the same tree, you will notice how the light falls under and through the boughs to strike always in the same pattern. You notice how it falls that way year after year, changing only with the seasons, and you think how you might go away and suffer death or torture by fire or flood, and the light always at the same hour in that season will be creeping around the bole2 of that beech tree.

It is like that with me when I think about Tom Rivers. I cannot understand how it was that he disappeared, leaving nowhere any trace of his going. I sit here in the late afternoon, and the long lances of shadow start from the garden fence and move slowly on, past the big sugar tree and past the beech tree, to halt for a moment at the little sugar tree that stands not fifty yards from my chair.

In the third paragraph (“There . . . tree”), the narrator’s descriptions of light falling through branches and shadows moving across the field primarily serve to
>>>
suggest that natural cycles can explain the mysteries of life
>>>
emphasize a difference between the regularity of nature and the unpredictability of humans

establish a context in which Tom Rivers’ actions will make sense in retrospect

imply that something about Tom Rivers’ personality would be out of place in nature

When they met at the culvert the next day, Sofia was dressed in black again. Her fingernails were also painted black. She led him south, down a gently curving street of assertive mansions, her black boots gliding over the sidewalk with steps that felt like flowing water to Nathan. Sofia was carrying a new map covered with topographical lines, and she studied it as they turned west and passed a buffet of overdone tributes to assorted architectural styles: a mini Monticello here, a bloated Tudor cottage* there. “This street follows the old streambed,” Sofia said. “The city buried it, like, a hundred years ago. But the water’s still flowing down there. In a big drainpipe.”

A block later they reached another fence, and stood above another culvert from which the stream emerged, moving slower, wide and shallower, flowing into a tangle of branches and bushes.

Without a word Sofia climbed the fence and landed with a splash in about an inch of water. “Technically, I’m pretty sure this is trespassing,” Nathan said as he followed her. Sofia marched along the water, pulling back branches for him. Where is this woman taking me? he wondered, and after a few paces he got his answer, as they entered an open space where the suddenly dry air seemed to vibrate under a liberated, ferocious sun. The space was a kind of meadow, framed by two mansions, each so abundant with backyard paraphernalia, Nathan felt as if he’d entered the prop closet of a studio dedicated to making movies about suburban American excess. He saw competing steel barbecue machines with gauges and propane-tank attachments; one stood before a tiled-roofed Spanish-style mansion, the other at the base of a turret-topped Moorish castle, as if ready to prepare steaks and burgers for a medieval army. Next to the Spanish mansion a pathway of flat stones led to a child’s climbing structure made of fiery redwood. The Moorish castle’s domain included a marble dining table and a tennis court of emerald cement.

Sofia’s stream snaked through this gaudy landscape, making two gentle turns inside a channel sunken in crabgrass. “I just want to look at it for a while, if you don’t mind,” Sofia said, and she sat down on the grass with her sleeved arms wrapped around her knees. The water flowed in a smooth, flat current, like a bonsai-shrunken version of the Mississippi.

Nathan looked up at the windows of the multistoried mansions around them and wondered if the people inside would call the cops.

“Really, you just want to sit here?” Nathan said.

Sofia nodded with a gentle, wordless insistence. He joined her for a second, sitting on the grass. The water was silent here, and the houses were silent too, though the birds in the trees around them were engaged in a jazz improv of tweets and hoots and cackles.

After five minutes Nathan mumbled, “I’m going to keep on exploring. I’ll meet you, uh, downstream, I guess.”

Sofia didn’t look up to acknowledge Nathan as he walked away. He was disturbed by the aching weirdness of what he was doing, trespassing amid fake backyard ecologies, the creek leading him on a midday sleepwalk past olive trees, a rosebush, assorted cacti, grapevines, and four cypress trees that loomed over him like monstrous green sentinels. He stepped over a low wooden fence and heard high-pitched yelling. Peering through a patch of ferns, he saw a swimming pool and two boys in bathing suits. One of the boys stopped at the edge of a diving board and stared at Nathan when he stepped out into the full sunlight. Nathan waved. The boy waved back and jumped into the pool with a percussive splash.

Sofia nodded with a gentle, wordless insistence. He joined her for a second, sitting on the grass. The water was silent here, and the houses were silent too, though the birds in the trees around them were engaged in a jazz improv of tweets and hoots and cackles.

After five minutes Nathan mumbled, “I’m going to keep on exploring. I’ll meet you, uh, downstream, I guess.”

Sofia didn’t look up to acknowledge Nathan as he walked away. He was disturbed by the aching weirdness of what he was doing, trespassing amid fake backyard ecologies, the creek leading him on a midday sleepwalk past olive trees, a rosebush, assorted cacti, grapevines, and four cypress trees that loomed over him like monstrous green sentinels. He stepped over a low wooden fence and heard high-pitched yelling. Peering through a patch of ferns, he saw a swimming pool and two boys in bathing suits. One of the boys stopped at the edge of a diving board and stared at Nathan when he stepped out into the full sunlight. Nathan waved. The boy waved back and jumped into the pool with a percussive splash.

 So OVER him,” I overhear. “But, like,

 It’s all OK. Like I don’t even LIKE
 Him anymore. Whatever. I’m all like ... ”
20 Take “like” out of our chat, we’d all alike
 Flounder, agape, gesticulating1 like
 A foreign film sans2 subtitles, fall like

25 We’re not just buying time on credit: Like
 Displaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,
 Endangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click “like”
 If you’re against extinction!) Like is like
 Invasive zebra mussels, or it’s like
30 Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike

 Inversions, archaisms, who just like
 Plain English as she’s spoke — why isn’t “like”
35 Their (literally) every other word? I’d like

Mending Wall
 Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
 That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
 And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
 And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
5The work of hunters is another thing:
 I have come after them and made repair
 Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
 But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
 To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
10No one has seen them made or heard them made,
 But at spring mending-time we find them there.
 I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
 And on a day we meet to walk the line
 And set the wall between us once again.
15We keep the wall between us as we go.
 To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
 And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
 We have to use a spell to make them balance:
 “Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”
20We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
 Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
 One on a side. It comes to little more:
 There where it is we do not need the wall:
 He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
25My apple trees will never get across
 And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
 He only says, “Good fences make good neighbors.”
 Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
 If I could put a notion in his head:
30“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it
 Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
 Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
 What I was walling in or walling out,
 And to whom I was like to give offense.
35Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
 That wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,
 But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
 He said it for himself. I see him there
 Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
40In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
 He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
 Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
 He will not go behind his father's saying,
 And he likes having thought of it so well

A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious* blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person’s lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one’s soul.

Ignatius himself was dressed comfortably and sensibly. The hunting cap prevented head colds. The voluminous tweed trousers were durable and permitted unusually free locomotion. Their pleats and nooks contained pockets of warm, stale air that soothed Ignatius. The plaid flannel shirt made a jacket unnecessary while the muffler guarded exposed Reilly skin between earflap and collar.

Shifting from one hip to the other in his lumbering, elephantine fashion, Ignatius sent waves of flesh rippling beneath the tweed and flannel, waves that broke upon buttons and seams. Thus rearranged, he contemplated the long while that he had been waiting for his mother. Principally he considered the discomfort he was beginning to feel. It seemed as if his whole being was ready to burst from his swollen suede desert boots, and, as if to verify this, Ignatius turned his singular eyes toward his feet. The feet did indeed look swollen. He was prepared to offer the sight of those bulging boots to his mother as evidence of her thoughtlessness. Looking up, he saw the sun beginning to descend over the Mississippi at the foot of Canal Street. The Holmes clock said almost five. Already he was polishing a few carefully worded accusations designed to reduce his mother to repentance or, at least, confusion. He often had to keep her in her place.

A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious* blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person’s lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one’s soul.

Ignatius himself was dressed comfortably and sensibly. The hunting cap prevented head colds. The voluminous tweed trousers were durable and permitted unusually free locomotion.

Conradin was ten years old, and the doctor had pronounced his professional opinion that the boy would not live another five years. The doctor was silky and effete, and counted for little, but his opinion was endorsed by Mrs. De Ropp, who counted for nearly everything. Mrs. De Ropp was Conradin’s cousin and guardian, and in his eyes she represented those three-fifths of the world that are necessary and disagreeable and real; the other two-fifths, in perpetual antagonism to the foregoing, were summed up in himself and his imagination. One of these days Conradin supposed he would succumb to the mastering pressure of wearisome necessary things—such as illnesses and coddling restrictions and drawn-out dullness. Without his imagination, which was rampant under the spur of loneliness, he would have succumbed long ago.

Mrs. De Ropp would never, in her honestest moments, have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him “for his good” was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome. Conradin hated her with a desperate sincerity which he was perfectly able to mask. Such few pleasures as he could contrive for himself gained an added relish from the likelihood that they would be displeasing to his guardian, and from the realm of his imagination she was locked out—an unclean thing, which should find no entrance.

In the dull, cheerless garden, overlooked by so many windows that were ready to open with a message not to do this or that, or a reminder that medicines were due, he found little attraction. The few fruit-trees that it contained were set jealously apart from his plucking, as though they were rare specimens of their kind blooming in an arid waste; it would probably have been difficult to find a market-gardener who would have offered ten shillings for their entire yearly produce. In a forgotten corner, however, almost hidden behind a dismal shrubbery, was a disused tool-shed of respectable proportions, and within its walls Conradin found a haven, something that took on the varying aspects of a playroom and a cathedral. He had peopled it with a legion of familiar phantoms, evoked partly from fragments of history and partly from his own brain, but it also boasted two inmates of flesh and blood. In one corner lived a ragged-plumaged Houdan hen, on which the boy lavished an affection that had scarcely another outlet. Further back in the gloom stood a large hutch, divided into two compartments, one of which was fronted with close iron bars. This was the abode of a large polecat-ferret, which a friendly butcher-boy had once smuggled, cage and all, into its present quarters, in exchange for a long-secreted hoard of small silver. Conradin was dreadfully afraid of the lithe, sharp-fanged beast, but it was his most treasured possession. Its very presence in the tool-shed was a secret and fearful joy, to be kept scrupulously from the knowledge of the Woman, as he privately dubbed his cousin. And one day, out of Heaven knows what material, he spun the beast a wonderful name, and from that moment it grew into a god and a religion.

It causes Conradin increased anxiety because he knows Mrs. De Ropp would not approve of it.
>>>
It presents Conradin with a moral predicament because he obtained it in an underhanded way.
>>>
It forces Conradin to give up the “Houdan hen” as the primary object of his “affection” (paragraph 3).
>>>
It fulfills Conradin’s imaginative ideal because he is able to transform it into “a god and a religion” (paragraph 3).
>>>
It encourages Conradin to consider reforming his negative attitude toward Mrs. De Ropp.
>>>

>>>
Conradin was ten years old, and the doctor had pronounced his professional opinion that the boy would not live another five years. The doctor was silky and effete, and counted for little, but his opinion was endorsed by Mrs. De Ropp, who counted for nearly everything. Mrs. De Ropp was Conradin’s cousin and guardian, and in his eyes she represented those three-fifths of the world that are necessary and disagreeable and real; the other two-fifths, in perpetual antagonism to the foregoing, were summed up in himself and his imagination. One of these days Conradin supposed he would succumb to the mastering pressure of wearisome necessary things—such as illnesses and coddling restrictions and drawn-out dullness. Without his imagination, which was rampant under the spur of loneliness, he would have succumbed long ago.

Mrs. De Ropp would never, in her honestest moments, have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin, though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him “for his good” was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome. Conradin hated her with a desperate sincerity which he was perfectly able to mask. Such few pleasures as he could contrive for himself gained an added relish from the likelihood that they would be displeasing to his guardian, and from the realm of his imagination she was locked out—an unclean thing, which should find no entrance.

In the dull, cheerless garden, overlooked by so many windows that were ready to open with a message not to do this or that, or a reminder that medicines were due, he found little attraction. The few fruit-trees that it contained were set jealously apart from his plucking, as though they were rare specimens of their kind blooming in an arid waste; it would probably have been difficult to find a market-gardener who would have offered ten shillings for their entire yearly produce. In a forgotten corner, however, almost hidden behind a dismal shrubbery, was a disused tool-shed of respectable proportions, and within its walls Conradin found a haven, something that took on the varying aspects of a playroom and a cathedral. He had peopled it with a legion of familiar phantoms, evoked partly from fragments of history and partly from his own brain, but it also boasted two inmates of flesh and blood. In one corner lived a ragged-plumaged Houdan hen, on which the boy lavished an affection that had scarcely another outlet. Further back in the gloom stood a large hutch, divided into two compartments, one of which was fronted with close iron bars. This was the abode of a large polecat-ferret, which a friendly butcher-boy had once smuggled, cage and all, into its present quarters, in exchange for a long-secreted hoard of small silver. Conradin was dreadfully afraid of the lithe, sharp-fanged beast, but it was his most treasured possession. Its very presence in the tool-shed was a secret and fearful joy, to be kept scrupulously from the knowledge of the Woman, as he privately dubbed his cousin. And one day, out of Heaven knows what material, he spun the beast a wonderful name, and from that moment it grew into a god and a religion.
>>>
Toward the end of the final paragraph, Conradin’s “exchange” of “a long-secreted hoard of small silver” with the butcher-boy is significant because it
>>>
reveals the great store of wealth to which Conradin has access
>>>
develops the idea that Conradin finds joy in acts that would be displeasing to Mrs. De Ropp
>>>
establishes the fact that Conradin has meaningful and well-established friendships
>>>
underscores Conradin’s main desire to live on the margins of society, ignoring its rules and customs
>>>
introduces an element of criminality into the passage that seems wholly out of character for Conradin

—New Orleans, November 1910
 Four weeks have passed since I left, and still
 I must write to you of no work. I’ve worn down
 the soles and walked through the tightness
 of my new shoes, calling upon the merchants,
5 their offices bustling. All the while I kept thinking
 my plain English and good writing would secure
 for me some modest position. Though I dress each day
 in my best, hands covered with the lace gloves
 you crocheted—no one needs a girl. How flat
 10the word sounds, and heavy. My purse thins.
 I spend foolishly to make an appearance of quiet
 industry, to mask the desperation that tightens
 my throat. I sit watching—
 though I pretend not to notice—the dark maids
 15ambling by with their white charges. Do I deceive
 anyone? Were they to see my hands, brown
 as your dear face, they’d know I’m not quite
 what I pretend to be. I walk these streets
 a white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes
 20of some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine,
 a negress again. There are enough things here
 to remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through
 the crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall
 the sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard
 25at school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking
 their tongues in conversation, carrying their loads
 on their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots
 and irons of the laundresses call to me. Here,
 I thought not to do the work I once did, back-bending
 30and domestic; my schooling a gift—even those half days
 at picking time, listening to Miss J—. How
 I’d come to know words, the recitations I practiced
 to sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up
 or trailing off at the ends. I read my books until
 35I nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field
 I repeated whole sections I’d learned by heart,
 spelling each word in my head to make a picture
 I could see, as well as a weight I could feel
 in my mouth. So now, even as I write this
 40and think of you at home, Good-bye
 is the waving map of your palm, is
 a stone on my tongue.

What is the source of the internal conflict acknowledged by the speaker?

TOM enters, dressed as a merchant sailor, and strolls across to the fire escape. There he stops and lights a cigarette. He addresses the audience.

TOM: Yes, I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion.

To begin with, I turn back time. I reverse it to that quaint period, the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. Their eyes had failed them, or they had failed their eyes, and so they were having their fingers pressed forcibly down on the fiery Braille alphabet of a dissolving economy.

In Spain there was revolution. Here there was only shouting and confusion. In Spain there was Guernica. Here there were disturbances of labor, sometimes pretty violent, in otherwise peaceful cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Saint Louis . . . This is the social background of the play.

(Music begins to play.)

The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings.

I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it. The other characters are my mother, Amanda, my sister, Laura, and a gentleman caller who appears in the final scenes. He is the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I have a poet’s weakness for symbols, I am using this character also as a symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for.

There is a fifth character in the play who doesn’t appear except in this larger-than-life-size photograph over the mantel. This is our father who left us a long time ago. He was a telephone man who fell in love with long distances; he gave up his job with the telephone company and skipped the light fantastic out of town . . .

The last we heard of him was a picture postcard from Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, containing a message of two words: “Hello—Goodbye!” and no address.

I think the rest of the play will explain itself. . . .

In Spain there was revolution. Here there was only shouting and confusion. In Spain there was Guernica. Here there were disturbances of labor, sometimes pretty violent, in otherwise peaceful cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Saint Louis . . . This is the social background of the play.

(Music begins to play.)

The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings.

I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it. The other characters are my mother, Amanda, my sister, Laura, and a gentleman caller who appears in the final scenes. He is the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I have a poet’s weakness for symbols, I am using this character also as a symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for.

There is a fifth character in the play who doesn’t appear except in this larger-than-life-size photograph over the mantel. This is our father who left us a long time ago. He was a telephone man who fell in love with long distances; he gave up his job with the telephone company and skipped the light fantastic out of town . . .

The last we heard of him was a picture postcard from Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, containing a message of two words: “Hello—Goodbye!” and no address.

TOM enters, dressed as a merchant sailor, and strolls across to the fire escape. There he stops and lights a cigarette. He addresses the audience.

TOM: Yes, I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion.

He found himself in a large apartment of polished stone. There were three doors; one on each of three sides; all similarly curtained with tapestry. The fourth side was occupied by two large windows and a great stone chimney-piece, carved with the arms of the Malétroits. Denis recognized the bearings1, and was gratified to find himself in such good hands. The room was strongly illuminated; but it contained little furniture except a heavy table and a chair or two, the hearth was innocent of fire, and the pavement was but sparsely strewn with rushes2 clearly many days old.

On a high chair beside the chimney, and directly facing Denis as he entered, sat a little old gentleman in a fur tippet.3 He sat with his legs crossed and his hands folded, and a cup of spiced wine stood by his elbow on a bracket on the wall. His countenance had a strongly masculine cast; not properly human, but such as we see in the bull, the goat, or the domestic boar; something equivocal and wheedling, something greedy, brutal, and dangerous. The upper lip was inordinately full, as though swollen by a blow or a toothache; and the smile, the peaked eyebrows, and the small, strong eyes were quaintly and almost comically evil in expression. Beautiful white hair hung straight all round his head, like a saint’s, and fell in a single curl upon the tippet. His beard and mustache were the pink of venerable sweetness. Age, probably in consequence of inordinate precautions, had left no mark upon his hands; and the Malétroit hand was famous. It would be difficult to imagine anything at once so fleshy and so delicate in design; the tapered, sensual fingers, were like those of one of Leonardo’s women; the fork of the thumb made a dimpled protuberance when closed; the nails were perfectly shaped, and of a dead, surprising whiteness. It rendered his aspect tenfold more redoubtable, that a man with hands like these should keep them devoutly folded like a virgin martyr—that a man with so intent and startling an expression of face should sit patiently on his seat and contemplate people with an unwinking stare, like a god, or a god’s statue. His quiescence4 seemed ironical and treacherous, it fitted so poorly with his looks.

Such was Alain, Sire de Malétroit.

Denis and he looked silently at each other for a second or two.

The juxtaposition of what Evans “wanted” (line 12) and “didn’t want” (line 14) serves to emphasize that Evans

preferred formal portraits rather than unposed candid photographs

tended to take photographs from a distance rather than at close range

The details about Aunt Grace in lines 15-17 (“my clumsy . . . floor”) suggest that, to the speaker, Aunt Grace is

an embodiment of the messiness of reality versus the order that art sometimes imposes

a representative of attitudes toward art and society that people held in the past

a kindred spirit who has similar experiences even though she lived in a different time

Mr. Murdock was one who carried no enthusiasm whatever for plays and their players, and that was too bad, for they meant so much to little Mrs. Murdock. Always she had been in a state of devout excitement over the luminous, free, passionate elect who serve the theater. And always she had done her wistful worshiping, along with the multitudes, at the great public altars. It is true that once, when she was a particularly little girl, love had impelled her to write Miss Maude Adams a letter beginning “Dearest Peter,” and she had received from Miss Adams a miniature thimble inscribed “A kiss from Peter Pan.” (That was a day!) And once, when her mother had taken her holiday shopping, a limousine door was held open and there had passed her, as close as that, a wonder of sable and violets and round red curls that seemed to tinkle on the air; so, forever after, she was as good as certain that she had been not a foot away from Miss Billie Burke. But until some three years after her marriage, these had remained her only personal experiences with the people of the lights and the glory.

Then it turned out that Miss Noyes, new come to little Mrs. Murdock’s own bridge club, knew an actress. She actually knew an actress; the way you and I know collectors of recipes and members of garden clubs and amateurs of needlepoint.

The name of the actress was Lily Wynton, and it was famous. She was tall and slow and silvery; often she appeared in the role of a duchess, or of a Lady Pam or an Honorable Moira. Critics recurrently referred to her as “that great lady of our stage.” Mrs. Murdock had attended, over years, matinee performances of the Wynton successes. And she had no more thought that she would one day have opportunity to meet Lily Wynton face to face than she had thought—well, than she had thought of flying!

Yet it was not astounding that Miss Noyes should walk at ease among the glamorous. Miss Noyes was full of depths and mystery, and she could talk with a cigarette still between her lips. She was always doing something difficult, like designing her own pajamas, or reading Proust, or modeling torsos in plasticine.* She played excellent bridge. She liked little Mrs. Murdock. “Tiny one,” she called her.

“How’s for coming to tea tomorrow, tiny one? Lily Wynton’s going to drop up,” she said, at a therefore memorable meeting of the bridge club. “You might like to meet her.”

The words fell so easily that she could not have realized their weight. Lily Wynton was coming to tea. Mrs. Murdock might like to meet her. Little Mrs. Murdock walked home through the early dark, and stars sang in the sky above her.

The shelves were packed close together, and it felt like I was standing at the border of a forest—not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight’s reach. There were ladders that clung to the shelves and rolled side to side. Usually those seem charming, but here, stretching up into the gloom, they were ominous. They whispered rumors of accidents in the dark.

So I stuck to the front half of the store, where bright midday light pressed in and presumably kept the wolves at bay. The wall around and above the door was glass, thick square panes set into a grid of black iron, and arched across them, in tall golden letters, it said (in reverse):

Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore is written in all capital letters as a mirror image.

Below that, set in the hollow of the arch, there was a symbol—two hands, perfectly flat, rising out of an open book.

So who was Mr. Penumbra?

“Hello, there,” a quiet voice called from the stacks. A figure emerged—a man, tall and skinny like one of the ladders, draped in a light gray button-down and a blue cardigan. He tottered as he walked, running a long hand along the shelves for support. When he came out of the shadows, I saw that his sweater matched his eyes, which were also blue, riding low in nests of wrinkles. He was very old.

He nodded at me and gave a weak wave. “What do you seek in these shelves?”

That was a good line, and for some reason, it made me feel comfortable. I asked, “Am I speaking to Mr. Penumbra?”

“I am Penumbra”—he nodded—“and I am the custodian of this place.”

I didn’t quite realize I was going to say it until I did: “I’m looking for a job.”

Penumbra blinked once, then nodded and tottered over to the desk set beside the front door. It was a massive block of dark-whorled wood, a solid fortress on the forest’s edge. You could probably defend it for days in the event of a siege from the shelves.

“Employment.” Penumbra nodded again. He slid up onto the chair behind the desk and regarded me across its bulk. “Have you ever worked at a bookstore before?”

“Well,” I said, “when I was in school I waited tables at a seafood restaurant, and the owner sold his own cookbook.” It was called The Secret Cod and it detailed thirty-one different ways to— You get it. “That probably doesn’t count.”

“No, it does not, but no matter,” Penumbra said. “Prior experience in the book trade is of little use to you here.”

Wait—maybe this place really was all erotica. I glanced down and around, but glimpsed no bodices, ripped or otherwise. In fact, just next to me there was a stack of dusty Dashiell Hammetts on a low table. That was a good sign.

“Tell me,” Penumbra said, “about a book you love.”

The shelves were packed close together, and it felt like I was standing at the border of a forest—not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight’s reach. There were ladders that clung to the shelves and rolled side to side. Usually those seem charming, but here, stretching up into the gloom, they were ominous. They whispered rumors of accidents in the dark.

So I stuck to the front half of the store, where bright midday light pressed in and presumably kept the wolves at bay. The wall around and above the door was glass, thick square panes set into a grid of black iron, and arched across them, in tall golden letters, it said (in reverse):

Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore is written in all capital letters as a mirror image.

Below that, set in the hollow of the arch, there was a symbol—two hands, perfectly flat, rising out of an open book.

So who was Mr. Penumbra?

“Hello, there,” a quiet voice called from the stacks. A figure emerged—a man, tall and skinny like one of the ladders, draped in a light gray button-down and a blue cardigan. He tottered as he walked, running a long hand along the shelves for support. When he came out of the shadows, I saw that his sweater matched his eyes, which were also blue, riding low in nests of wrinkles. He was very old.

He nodded at me and gave a weak wave. “What do you seek in these shelves?”

That was a good line, and for some reason, it made me feel comfortable. I asked, “Am I speaking to Mr. Penumbra?”

“I am Penumbra”—he nodded—“and I am the custodian of this place.”

I didn’t quite realize I was going to say it until I did: “I’m looking for a job.”

Penumbra blinked once, then nodded and tottered over to the desk set beside the front door. It was a massive block of dark-whorled wood, a solid fortress on the forest’s edge. You could probably defend it for days in the event of a siege from the shelves.

“Employment.” Penumbra nodded again. He slid up onto the chair behind the desk and regarded me across its bulk. “Have you ever worked at a bookstore before?”

“Well,” I said, “when I was in school I waited tables at a seafood restaurant, and the owner sold his own cookbook.” It was called The Secret Cod and it detailed thirty-one different ways to— You get it. “That probably doesn’t count.”

“No, it does not, but no matter,” Penumbra said. “Prior experience in the book trade is of little use to you here.”

Wait—maybe this place really was all erotica. I glanced down and around, but glimpsed no bodices, ripped or otherwise. In fact, just next to me there was a stack of dusty Dashiell Hammetts on a low table. That was a good sign.

“Tell me,” Penumbra said, “about a book you love.”

I knew my answer immediately. No competition. I told him, “Mr. Penumbra, it’s not one book, but a series.

Now, I faced solitude of a rare purity. In the darkness, above the sheer drop, I could see the lights of Forty-second Street flashing in the visible distance. The railings of the fire escape, which were probably precarious at the best of times, were slicked with water and inimical1 to the grip. I moved carefully, taking step after premeditated step. The wind pushed around the building noisily, and I took some grim comfort in the idea that, if I were to fall from that height, there was no question of being maimed: death would be instant. The thought calmed me, and I stepped and slid down the metal steps, a few modest inches at a time. My high-wire act continued for long minutes in the darkness. And then I saw that the fire escape went only halfway down the building, ending abruptly at another closed door. The rest of the way down to the ground, some two flights, was air alone. But luck was with me: this second door had a handle. I tried it and it opened, into a hallway.

Before I entered the door, holding it open with relief and gratitude, it occurred to me to look straight up, and much to my surprise, there were stars. Stars! I hadn’t thought I would be able to see them, not with the light pollution perpetually wreathing the city, and not on a night on which it had been raining. But the rain had stopped while I was climbing down, and had washed the air clean. The miasma2 of Manhattan’s electric lights did not go very far up into the sky, and in the moonless night, the sky was like a roof shot through with light, and heaven itself shimmered. Wonderful stars, a distant cloud of fireflies: but I felt in my body what my eyes could not grasp, which was that their true nature was the persisting visual echo of something that was already in the past. In the unfathomable ages it took for light to cross such distances, the light source itself had in some cases been long extinguished, its dark remains stretched away from us at ever greater speeds.

But, in the dark spaces between the dead, shining stars, were stars I could not see, stars that still existed, and were giving out light that hadn’t reached me yet, stars now living and giving out light but present to me only as blank interstices. Their light would arrive on earth eventually, long after I and my whole generation and the generation after me had slipped out of time, perhaps long after the human race itself was extinguished. To look into those dark spaces was to have a direct glimpse of the future. I gripped the rusted railing of the fire escape with one hand and tightened my hold on the open door with the other. The night air clipped my ears. I looked down, a steep drop, and the blurred yellow rectangle of a taxicab sped by, and then an ambulance, its wailing reaching me from seven floors below, and stretching out as it headed toward Times Square’s neon inferno. I wished I could meet the unseen starlight halfway, starlight that was unreachable because my entire being was caught up in a blind spot, starlight that was coming as fast as it could, covering almost seven hundred million miles every hour. It would arrive in due time, and cast its illumination on other humans, or perhaps on other configurations of our world, after unimaginable catastrophes had altered it beyond recognition. My hands held metal, my eyes starlight, and it was as though I had come so close to something that it had fallen out of focus, or fallen so far away from it that it had faded away.

Now, I faced solitude of a rare purity. In the darkness, above the sheer drop, I could see the lights of Forty-second Street flashing in the visible distance. The railings of the fire escape, which were probably precarious at the best of times, were slicked with water and inimical1 to the grip. I moved carefully, taking step after premeditated step. The wind pushed around the building noisily, and I took some grim comfort in the idea that, if I were to fall from that height, there was no question of being maimed: death would be instant. The thought calmed me, and I stepped and slid down the metal steps, a few modest inches at a time. My high-wire act continued for long minutes in the darkness. And then I saw that the fire escape went only halfway down the building, ending abruptly at another closed door. The rest of the way down to the ground, some two flights, was air alone. But luck was with me: this second door had a handle. I tried it and it opened, into a hallway.

Before I entered the door, holding it open with relief and gratitude, it occurred to me to look straight up, and much to my surprise, there were stars. Stars! I hadn’t thought I would be able to see them, not with the light pollution perpetually wreathing the city, and not on a night on which it had been raining. But the rain had stopped while I was climbing down, and had washed the air clean. The miasma2 of Manhattan’s electric lights did not go very far up into the sky, and in the moonless night, the sky was like a roof shot through with light, and heaven itself shimmered. Wonderful stars, a distant cloud of fireflies: but I felt in my body what my eyes could not grasp, which was that their true nature was the persisting visual echo of something that was already in the past. In the unfathomable ages it took for light to cross such distances, the light source itself had in some cases been long extinguished, its dark remains stretched away from us at ever greater speeds.

But, in the dark spaces between the dead, shining stars, were stars I could not see, stars that still existed, and were giving out light that hadn’t reached me yet, stars now living and giving out light but present to me only as blank interstices. Their light would arrive on earth eventually, long after I and my whole generation and the generation after me had slipped out of time, perhaps long after the human race itself was extinguished. To look into those dark spaces was to have a direct glimpse of the future. I gripped the rusted railing of the fire escape with one hand and tightened my hold on the open door with the other. The night air clipped my ears. I looked down, a steep drop, and the blurred yellow rectangle of a taxicab sped by, and then an ambulance, its wailing reaching me from seven floors below, and stretching out as it headed toward Times Square’s neon inferno. I wished I could meet the unseen starlight halfway, starlight that was unreachable because my entire being was caught up in a blind spot, starlight that was coming as fast as it could, covering almost seven hundred million miles every hour. It would arrive in due time, and cast its illumination on other humans, or perhaps on other configurations of our world, after unimaginable catastrophes had altered it beyond recognition. My hands held metal, my eyes starlight, and it was as though I had come so close to something that it had fallen out of focus, or fallen so far away from it that it had faded away.

Night
1 I stood and watched the still, mysterious Night,
 Steal from her shadowy caverns in the East,
 To work her deep enchantments on the world.
 Her black veil floated down the silent glens,
5 While her dark sandalled feet, with noiseless tread,
 Moved to a secret harmony. Along
 The brows of the majestic hills, she strung
 Her glorious diamonds so stealthily,
 It never marred their dreams; and in the deep,
 10Cool thickets of the wood, where scarce the Day
 Could reach the dim retreat, her dusky hand
 Pinned on the breast of the exhaling flower,
 A glittering gem; while all the tangled ferns
 And forest lace-work, as she moved along,
 15Grew moist and shining.
 Who would e’er have guessed,
 The queenly Night would deign to stoop and love
 A little flower! And yet, with all her stealth,
 I saw her press her damp and cooling lip
 20Upon the feverish bosom of a Rose;
 At which a watchful bird poured sudden forth
 A love-sick song, of sweet and saddest strain.
 Upon the ivied rocks, and rugged crags
 On which the ocean billows break, she hung
 25Her sombre mantle; and the gray old sea
 That had been high in tumult all the day,
 Became so mesmerized beneath her wiles,
 He seemed a mere reflection of herself.
 The billows sank into a dimpled sleep;
 30Only the little tide-waves glided up
 To kiss the blackness of the airy robe
 That floated o’er them.
 Long I stood and watched
 The mystic, spell-like influence of Night;
 35Till o’er the eastern hills, came up the first
 Faint glories of the crown that Phoebus* wears.
 And soon, the Earth, surprised to see the work
 That Night had wrought, began to glow and blush,
 Like maidens, conscious of the glance of Love.
 40While she, — the dark Enchantress, — like to one
 Who decorates her bower with all things fair,
 Wherewith to please her lover, but yet flees
 At his approaching step, — at the first gleam
 That lit the zenith from the Day-god’s eye,
 45Fled timid o’er the distant western hills.

 Upon the ivied rocks, and rugged crags
 On which the ocean billows break, she hung
 25Her sombre mantle; and the gray old sea
 That had been high in tumult all the day,
 Became so mesmerized beneath her wiles,
 He seemed a mere reflection of herself.
 The billows sank into a dimpled sleep;
 30Only the little tide-waves glided up
 To kiss the blackness of the airy robe
 That floated o’er them.
 Long I stood and watched
 The mystic, spell-like influence of Night;
 35Till o’er the eastern hills, came up the first
 Faint glories of the crown that Phoebus* wears.
 And soon, the Earth, surprised to see the work
 That Night had wrought, began to glow and blush,
 Like maidens, conscious of the glance of Love.
 40While she, — the dark Enchantress, — like to one
 Who decorates her bower with all things fair,
 Wherewith to please her lover, but yet flees
 At his approaching step, — at the first gleam
 That lit the zenith from the Day-god’s eye,
 45Fled timid o’er the distant western hills.

Night
1 I stood and watched the still, mysterious Night,
 Steal from her shadowy caverns in the East,
 To work her deep enchantments on the world.
 Her black veil floated down the silent glens,
5 While her dark sandalled feet, with noiseless tread,
 Moved to a secret harmony. Along
 The brows of the majestic hills, she strung
 Her glorious diamonds so stealthily,
 It never marred their dreams; and in the deep,
 10Cool thickets of the wood, where scarce the Day
 Could reach the dim retreat, her dusky hand
 Pinned on the breast of the exhaling flower,
 A glittering gem; while all the tangled ferns
 And forest lace-work, as she moved along,
 15Grew moist and shining.
 Who would e’er have guessed,
 The queenly Night would deign to stoop and love
 A little flower! And yet, with all her stealth,
 I saw her press her damp and cooling lip
 20Upon the feverish bosom of a Rose;
 At which a watchful bird poured sudden forth
 A love-sick song, of sweet and saddest strain.
 Upon the ivied rocks, and rugged crags
 On which the ocean billows break, she hung
 25Her sombre mantle; and the gray old sea
 That had been high in tumult all the day,
 Became so mesmerized beneath her wiles,
 He seemed a mere reflection of herself.

A Poet to His Baby Son
 Tiny bit of humanity,
 Blessed with your mother’s face,
 And cursed with your father’s mind.
 I say cursed with your father’s mind,
5Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back,
 Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot,
 And looking away,
 Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond.
 Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet?
10Why don’t you kick and howl,
 And make the neighbors talk about
 “That damned baby next door,”
 And make up your mind forthwith
 To grow up and be a banker
15Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter
 Or—?—whatever you decide upon,
 Rid yourself of these incipient1 thoughts
 About being a poet.
 For poets no longer are makers of songs,
20Chanters of the gold and purple harvest,
 Sayers of the glories of earth and sky,
 Of the sweet pain of love
 And the keen joy of living;
 No longer dreamers of the essential dreams,
25And interpreters of the eternal truth,
 Through the eternal beauty.
 Poets these days are unfortunate fellows.
 Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way
 Or new things in an old language,
30They talk abracadabra
 In an unknown tongue,
 Each one fashioning for himself
 A wordy world of shadow problems,
 And as a self-imagined Atlas,2
35Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,
 Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load.
 My son, this is no time nor place for a poet;
 Grow up and join the big, busy crowd
 That scrambles for what it thinks it wants
40Out of this old world which is—as it is—
 And, probably, always will be.
 Take the advice of a father who knows:
 You cannot begin too young
 Not to be a poet.

 A wordy world of shadow problems,
 And as a self-imagined Atlas,2
35Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,
 Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load.
 My son, this is no time nor place for a poet;
 Grow up and join the big, busy crowd
 That scrambles for what it thinks it wants
40Out of this old world which is—as it is—
 And, probably, always will be.
 Take the advice of a father who knows:
 You cannot begin too young
 Not to be a poet.

The allusion to Atlas in line 34 primarily serves to suggest that modern poets

claim to feel unworthy of the public’s praise

wish to tell fantastic stories about exotic locations

possess an exaggerated sense of their own importance

express their ideas through old-fashioned imagery

tend to avoid tasks that seem particularly difficult

A Poet to His Baby Son
 Tiny bit of humanity,
 Blessed with your mother’s face,
 And cursed with your father’s mind.
 I say cursed with your father’s mind,
5Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back,
 Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot,
 And looking away,
 Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond.
 Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet?
10Why don’t you kick and howl,
 And make the neighbors talk about
 “That damned baby next door,”
 And make up your mind forthwith
 To grow up and be a banker
15Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter
 Or—?—whatever you decide upon,
 Rid yourself of these incipient1 thoughts
 About being a poet.
 For poets no longer are makers of songs,
20Chanters of the gold and purple harvest,
 Sayers of the glories of earth and sky,
 Of the sweet pain of love
 And the keen joy of living;
 No longer dreamers of the essential dreams,
25And interpreters of the eternal truth,
 Through the eternal beauty.
 Poets these days are unfortunate fellows.
 Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way
 Or new things in an old language,
30They talk abracadabra
 In an unknown tongue,
 Each one fashioning for himself
 A wordy world of shadow problems,
 And as a self-imagined Atlas,2
35Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,
 Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load.
 My son, this is no time nor place for a poet;
 Grow up and join the big, busy crowd
 That scrambles for what it thinks it wants
40Out of this old world which is—as it is—
 And, probably, always will be.
 Take the advice of a father who knows:
 You cannot begin too young
 Not to be a poet.

The two three-line stanzas in lines 1-3 and in lines 42-44 have the effect of framing the poem as

an impatient and scornful set of instructions
>>>
a brief and powerful confession

a terse and reproachful accusation
>>>
a concise and counterintuitive message
>>>
a short and sincere wish

(1) CYNTHIA: On a cruise, Panama Canal. That’s where I’d like to be right now. Poolside, piña colada in my hand. High and happy.

(2) STAN: A nice breeze blowing off the water. Not a bad way to spend your birthday. You all right? Hot in here? You want me to crank the air?

(3) CYNTHIA: Nah, I’m okay.

(Cynthia looks around.)

I was kinda hoping they’d show up. It’s the one thing we always do together.

(4) STAN: Can you blame ‘em?

(5) CYNTHIA: Like I had a choice.

(6) STAN: I’m just saying.

(7) CYNTHIA: C’mon, Don’t gimme that look.

(8) STAN: Well, it can’t be easy.

(9) CYNTHIA: It isn’t . . . You know what’s crazy, when I started at the plant it felt like I was invited into an exclusive club. Not many of us folks worked there. Not us. So, when I put on my jacket, I knew I’d accomplished something. I was set. And when I got my union card, you couldn’t tell me anything. Sometimes when I was shopping I would let it slip out of my wallet onto the counter just so folks could see it. I was that proud of it.

(10) STAN: I remember the feeling.

(Cynthia smiles.)

(11) CYNTHIA: Right. No one in my family ever made it beyond the floor.

(12) STAN: Yup . . .

(13) CYNTHIA: And, I wanted this job so bad. Ever since I stepped into the plant, and saw how the white hats left work in clothes as clean as when they walked in. They seemed untouchable.

(14) STAN: How are you holding up?

(15) CYNTHIA: [. . .] I locked out my friends, Stan. I explained, I fought, I begged. But those cowards upstairs still had me tape a note to the door telling ‘em they weren’t welcome. Ninety-five degrees. I’m standing in the door watching some irritable fat guy change the locks. Shut outta the plant. And you know what? I wonder if they gave me this job on purpose. Pin a target on me so they can stay in their air-conditioned offices. Do you know what it feels like, to say to the people you’ve worked with for years that they’re not welcome anymore? I haven’t slept in . . . in over a week.

(16) STAN: Well, you’re not alone.

(17) CYNTHIA: I’m scared, Stan. I got a mortgage to meet, car payments, and Brucie, you’ve seen what being outta work has done to him. I’m not going down that way, I’ve worked too hard. Am I wrong?

(18) STAN: Jesus.

(19) CYNTHIA: I know. I know. But what could I have done? You tell me! The plant offered them a deal. The union voted it down. Not me!

(20) STAN: What do you want me to say, sweetheart? Those are my friends.

(21) CYNTHIA: Our friends.

(22) STAN: Then imagine how they feel. Some folks wouldn’t even want me to pour you a drink.

(23) CYNTHIA: I’ve lived half my life on that floor. My son was practically born in that place. So don’t get sanctimonious with me.

(24) STAN: Okay, I’ll keep out of it, but you know people will say what they say.

(25) CYNTHIA: I thought they’d take the damn deal. You think I’m happy about this? I locked out my own son. My own son. I saw the hurt on his face. But you wanna know the truth, and this is the truth, maybe it’s for the best, right? It’ll finally get him out of this sinkhole.

(8) STAN: Well, it can’t be easy.

(9) CYNTHIA: It isn’t . . . You know what’s crazy, when I started at the plant it felt like I was invited into an exclusive club. Not many of us folks worked there. Not us. So, when I put on my jacket, I knew I’d accomplished something. I was set. And when I got my union card, you couldn’t tell me anything. Sometimes when I was shopping I would let it slip out of my wallet onto the counter just so folks could see it. I was that proud of it.

(10) STAN: I remember the feeling.

(Cynthia smiles.)

(11) CYNTHIA: Right. No one in my family ever made it beyond the floor.

(12) STAN: Yup . . .

(13) CYNTHIA: And, I wanted this job so bad. Ever since I stepped into the plant, and saw how the white hats left work in clothes as clean as when they walked in. They seemed untouchable.

(14) STAN: How are you holding up?

(15) CYNTHIA: [. . .] I locked out my friends, Stan. I explained, I fought, I begged. But those cowards upstairs still had me tape a note to the door telling ‘em they weren’t welcome. Ninety-five degrees. I’m standing in the door watching some irritable fat guy change the locks. Shut outta the plant. And you know what? I wonder if they gave me this job on purpose. Pin a target on me so they can stay in their air-conditioned offices. Do you know what it feels like, to say to the people you’ve worked with for years that they’re not welcome anymore? I haven’t slept in . . . in over a week.

(16) STAN: Well, you’re not alone.

(17) CYNTHIA: I’m scared, Stan. I got a mortgage to meet, car payments, and Brucie, you’ve seen what being outta work has done to him. I’m not going down that way, I’ve worked too hard. Am I wrong?

(18) STAN: Jesus.

(19) CYNTHIA: I know. I know. But what could I have done? You tell me! The plant offered them a deal. The union voted it down. Not me!

(20) STAN: What do you want me to say, sweetheart? Those are my friends.

(21) CYNTHIA: Our friends.

(22) STAN: Then imagine how they feel. Some folks wouldn’t even want me to pour you a drink.

(23) CYNTHIA: I’ve lived half my life on that floor. My son was practically born in that place. So don’t get sanctimonious with me.

(24) STAN: Okay, I’ll keep out of it, but you know people will say what they say.

(25) CYNTHIA: I thought they’d take the damn deal. You think I’m happy about this? I locked out my own son. My own son. I saw the hurt on his face. But you wanna know the truth, and this is the truth, maybe it’s for the best, right? It’ll finally get him out of this sinkhole.

Giving Back the Flower
1 So, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,
 And to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair,
 Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,
 And to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,
 5Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew
 That I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free.
 When I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;
 It was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.
 Ah? so God is your witness. Has God, then, no world to look after but ours?
 10May He not have been searching for that wild star, with the trailing plumage, that flew
 Far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers,
 Or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?
 Or, if He was near us at all, do you think that He would sit listening there
 Because you sang “Hear me, Norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace,
 15While, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air,
 There were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned His grace?
 Or perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day,
 To number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead;
 Or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay;
 20At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said.
 So take back your flower, I tell you—of its sweetness I now have no need;
 Yes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep;
 When you wake I will take it, and God, then, perhaps will witness indeed,
 But go, now, and tell Death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep.

 A birdsnest built on the palm of the high-
 Most bough of an elm, this morning as I came by
 A brute gust lifted-and-left in the midst of the air;
 Whereat the leaves went quiet, and there
5Was a moment of silence in honor of
 The sweetness of danger. The chalice now bobbing above,
 Of interlaid daintiest timber, began the chute
 Down forty fell feet toward stone and root
 With a drift and a sampan1 spin, and gripped
10Loosely its fine shelled life; now viciously tipped
 By a ripple of air, with an acrobat’s quick not-quite-
 Lost, dipped lower to whirl upright;
 Then, with a straight-down settling, it
 Descended into sunshine, and, with a hushed touch, lit
15On a mesa of strenuous grass. Oh risk-hallowed eggs, oh
 Triumph of lightness! Legerity2 begs no
 Quarter: my Aunt Virginia, when
 She’d relapsed and recovered, would sit in the garden again
 Waiting, all lapped in an indigo-flowered shawl,
20In white for her “regular customers’” call;
 Whose pity she parried with very-blue-eyed
 Attention, and giggled and patted their hands when they tried
 To do-something-for-her; she sat in the heart of her days
 And watched with a look of peculiar praise;
25Her slight voice could catch a pleasure complete
 As a gull takes a fish at the flash of his side. Her great
 Heavy husband adored her, would treat with a sudden blind sally
 Of softness his “visitor from the valley”;
 He called her “Birdie,” which was good, for him.
30And he and the others, the strong, the involved, in-the-swim,
 Seeing her there in the garden, in her gray shroud
 As vague and as self-possessed as a cloud,
 Requiring nothing of them any more,
 And one hand lightly laid on a fatal door,
35Thought of the health of the sick, and, what mocked their sighing,
 Of the strange intactness of the gladly dying.

15On a mesa of strenuous grass. Oh risk-hallowed eggs, oh
 Triumph of lightness! Legerity2 begs no
 Quarter: my Aunt Virginia, when
 She’d relapsed and recovered, would sit in the garden again
 Waiting, all lapped in an indigo-flowered shawl,
20In white for her “regular customers’” call;
 Whose pity she parried with very-blue-eyed
 Attention, and giggled and patted their hands when they tried
 To do-something-for-her; she sat in the heart of her days
 And watched with a look of peculiar praise;
25Her slight voice could catch a pleasure complete
 As a gull takes a fish at the flash of his side. Her great
 Heavy husband adored her, would treat with a sudden blind sally
 Of softness his “visitor from the valley”;
 He called her “Birdie,” which was good, for him.
30And he and the others, the strong, the involved, in-the-swim,
 Seeing her there in the garden, in her gray shroud
 As vague and as self-possessed as a cloud,
 Requiring nothing of them any more,
 And one hand lightly laid on a fatal door,
35Thought of the health of the sick, and, what mocked their sighing,
 Of the strange intactness of the gladly dying.

What function does Aunt Virginia’s self-possession, her “intactness” (line 36), serve within the context of the poem?
>>>
It contradicts her outwardly jovial demeanor.
>>>
It undermines her sense of fulfillment.
>>>
It reinforces her stern notions of morality.
>>>
It clarifies her serene acceptance of mortality.
>>>
It underscores her unspoken desire for solitude.

Lightness
 A birdsnest built on the palm of the high-
 Most bough of an elm, this morning as I came by
 A brute gust lifted-and-left in the midst of the air;
 Whereat the leaves went quiet, and there
5Was a moment of silence in honor of
 The sweetness of danger. The chalice now bobbing above,
 Of interlaid daintiest timber, began the chute
 Down forty fell feet toward stone and root
 With a drift and a sampan1 spin, and gripped
10Loosely its fine shelled life; now viciously tipped
 By a ripple of air, with an acrobat’s quick not-quite-
 Lost, dipped lower to whirl upright;
 Then, with a straight-down settling, it
 Descended into sunshine, and, with a hushed touch, lit
15On a mesa of strenuous grass. Oh risk-hallowed eggs, oh
 Triumph of lightness! Legerity2 begs no
 Quarter: my Aunt Virginia, when

 Waiting, all lapped in an indigo-flowered shawl,

 Attention, and giggled and patted their hands when they tried
 To do-something-for-her; she sat in the heart of her days

You don’t look so dreadful poor in the face as you did a while back. Bloated some, I expect.

This was the cheerful and encouraging and elegant remark with which the Poor Relation greeted the divinity-student one morning.

Of course every good man considers it a great sacrifice on his part to continue living in this transitory, unsatisfactory, and particularly unpleasant world. This is so much a matter of course, that I was surprised to see the divinity-student change color. He took a look at a small and uncertain-minded glass which hung slanting forward over the chapped sideboard. The image it returned to him had the color of a very young pea somewhat over-boiled. The scenery of a long tragic drama flashed through his mind as the lightning-express-train whishes by a station: the gradual dismantling process of disease; friends looking on, sympathetic, but secretly chuckling over their own stomachs of iron and lungs of caoutchouc1; nurses attentive, but calculating their crop, and thinking how soon it will be ripe, so that they can go to your neighbor, who is good for a year or so longer; doctors assiduous, but giving themselves a mental shake, as they go out of your door, which throws off your particular grief as a duck sheds a raindrop from his oily feathers; undertakers solemn, but happy; then the great subsoil cultivator, who plants, but never looks for fruit in his garden; then the stone-cutter, who puts your name on the slab which has been waiting for you ever since the birds or beasts made their tracks on the new red sandstone; then the grass and the dandelions and the buttercups, —Earth saying to the mortal body, with her sweet symbolism, “You have scarred my bosom, but you are forgiven”; then a glimpse of the soul as a floating consciousness without very definite form or place, but dimly conceived of as an upright column of vapor or mist several times larger than life-size, so far as it could be said to have any size at all, wandering about and living a thin and half-awake life for want of good old-fashioned solid matter to come down upon with foot and fist, —in fact, having neither foot nor fist, nor conveniences for taking the sitting posture.

And yet the divinity-student was a good Christian, and those heathen images which remind one of the childlike fancies of the dying Adrian2 were only the efforts of his imagination to give shape to the formless and position to the placeless. Neither did his thoughts spread themselves out and link themselves as I have displayed them. They came confusedly into his mind like a heap of broken mosaics, —sometimes a part of the picture complete in itself, sometimes connected fragments, and sometimes only single severed stones.

They did not diffuse a light of celestial joy over his countenance. On the contrary, the Poor Relation’s remark turned him pale, as I have said; and when the terrible wrinkled and jaundiced looking-glass turned him green in addition, and he saw himself in it, it seemed to him as if it were all settled, and his book of life were to be shut not yet half-read, and go back to the dust of the under-ground archives. He coughed a mild short cough, as if to point the direction in which his downward path was tending.

The Good-Morrow
1 I wonder, by my troth,1 what thou and I
 Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then,
 But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
 Or snorted we in the seven sleepers’ den?2
5’Twas so; But this, all pleasures fancies be.
 If ever any beauty I did see,
 Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.
 And now good morrow to our waking souls,
 Which watch not one another out of fear;
10 For love all love of other sights controls,
 And makes one little room an everywhere.
 Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
 Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
 Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one.
15 My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,
 And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
 Where can we find two better hemispheres,
 Without sharp North, without declining West?
 Whatever dies was not mixed equally;
20 If our two loves be one, or thou and I
 Love so alike that none do slacken, none can die.

Love needs to be restrained so that one person’s identity is not lost in the other’s.

The Good-Morrow
1 I wonder, by my troth,1 what thou and I
 Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then,
 But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
 Or snorted we in the seven sleepers’ den?2
5’Twas so; But this, all pleasures fancies be.
 If ever any beauty I did see,
 Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.
 And now good morrow to our waking souls,
 Which watch not one another out of fear;
10 For love all love of other sights controls,
 And makes one little room an everywhere.

The Death of Allegory
1 I am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions
 that used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings
 and parade about on the pages of the Renaissance
 displaying their capital letters like license plates.
5 Truth cantering on a powerful horse,
 Chastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.
 Each one was marble come to life, a thought in a coat,
 Courtesy bowing with one hand always extended,
 Villainy sharpening an instrument behind a wall,
10 Reason with her crown and Constancy alert behind a helm.1
 They are all retired now, consigned to a Florida for tropes.2
 Justice is there standing by an open refrigerator.
 Valor lies in bed listening to the rain.
 Even Death has nothing to do but mend his cloak and hood,
15 and all their props are locked away in a warehouse,
 hourglasses, globes, blindfolds and shackles.
 Even if you called them back, there are no places left
 for them to go, no Garden of Mirth or Bower of Bliss.
 The Valley of Forgiveness is lined with condominiums
20 and chain saws are howling in the Forest of Despair.
 Here on the table near the window is a vase of peonies
 and next to it black binoculars and a money clip,
 exactly the kind of thing we now prefer,
 objects that sit quietly on a line in lower case,
25 themselves and nothing more, a wheelbarrow,
 an empty mailbox, a razor blade resting in a glass ashtray.
 As for the others, the great ideas on horseback
 and the long-haired virtues in embroidered gowns,
 it looks as though they have traveled down
30 that road you see on the final page of storybooks,
 the one that winds up a green hillside and disappears
 into an unseen valley where everyone must be fast asleep.

deeper and immediately recognizable significance

Her doctor had told Julian’s mother that she must lose twenty pounds on account of her blood pressure, so on Wednesday nights Julian had to take her downtown on the bus for a reducing class at the Y. The reducing class was designed for working girls over fifty, who weighed from 165 to 200 pounds. His mother was one of the slimmer ones, but she said ladies did not tell their age or weight. She would not ride the buses by herself at night since they had been integrated, and because the reducing class was one of her few pleasures, necessary for her health, and free, she said Julian could at least put himself out to take her, considering all she did for him. Julian did not like to consider all she did for him, but every Wednesday night he braced himself and took her.

She was almost ready to go, standing before the hall mirror, putting on her hat, while he, his hands behind him, appeared pinned to the door frame, waiting like Saint Sebastian for the arrows to begin piercing him.* The hat was new and had cost her seven dollars and a half. She kept saying, “Maybe I shouldn’t have paid that for it. No, I shouldn’t have. I’ll take it off and return it tomorrow. I shouldn’t have bought it.”

Julian raised his eyes to heaven. “Yes, you should have bought it,” he said. “Put it on and let’s go.” It was a hideous hat. A purple velvet flap came down on one side of it and stood up on the other; the rest of it was green and looked like a cushion with the stuffing out. He decided it was less comical than jaunty and pathetic. Everything that gave her pleasure was small and depressed him.

She lifted the hat one more time and set it down slowly on top of her head. Two wings of gray hair protruded on either side of her florid face, but her eyes, sky-blue, were as innocent and untouched by experience as they must have been when she was ten. Were it not that she was a widow who had struggled fiercely to feed and clothe and put him through school and who was supporting him still, “until he got on his feet,” she might have been a little girl that he had to take to town.

“It’s all right, it’s all right,” he said. “Let’s go.” He opened the door himself and started down the walk to get her going. The sky was a dying violet and the houses stood out darkly against it, bulbous liver-colored monstrosities of a uniform ugliness though no two were alike. Since this had been a fashionable neighborhood forty years ago, his mother persisted in thinking they did well to have an apartment in it. Each house had a narrow collar of dirt around it in which sat, usually, a grubby child. Julian walked out with his hands in his pockets, his head down and thrust forward and his eyes glazed with the determination to make himself completely numb during the time he would be sacrificed to her pleasure.

The door closed and he turned to find the dumpy figure, surmounted by the atrocious hat, coming toward him. “Well,” she said, “you only live once and paying a little more for it, I at least won’t meet myself coming and going.”

“Some day I’ll start making money,” Julian said gloomily—he knew he never would—“and you can have one of those jokes whenever you take the fit.” But first they would move. He visualized a place where the nearest neighbors would be three miles away on either side.

“I think you’re doing fine,” she said, drawing on her gloves. “You’ve only been out of school a year. Rome wasn’t built in a day.”

The door closed and he turned to find the dumpy figure, surmounted by the atrocious hat, coming toward him. “Well,” she said, “you only live once and paying a little more for it, I at least won’t meet myself coming and going.”

“Some day I’ll start making money,” Julian said gloomily—he knew he never would—“and you can have one of those jokes whenever you take the fit.” But first they would move. He visualized a place where the nearest neighbors would be three miles away on either side.

“I think you’re doing fine,” she said, drawing on her gloves. “You’ve only been out of school a year. Rome wasn’t built in a day.”

Her doctor had told Julian’s mother that she must lose twenty pounds on account of her blood pressure, so on Wednesday nights Julian had to take her downtown on the bus for a reducing class at the Y. The reducing class was designed for working girls over fifty, who weighed from 165 to 200 pounds. His mother was one of the slimmer ones, but she said ladies did not tell their age or weight. She would not ride the buses by herself at night since they had been integrated, and because the reducing class was one of her few pleasures, necessary for her health, and free, she said Julian could at least put himself out to take her, considering all she did for him. Julian did not like to consider all she did for him, but every Wednesday night he braced himself and took her.

She was almost ready to go, standing before the hall mirror, putting on her hat, while he, his hands behind him, appeared pinned to the door frame, waiting like Saint Sebastian for the arrows to begin piercing him.* The hat was new and had cost her seven dollars and a half. She kept saying, “Maybe I shouldn’t have paid that for it. No, I shouldn’t have. I’ll take it off and return it tomorrow. I shouldn’t have bought it.”

Julian raised his eyes to heaven. “Yes, you should have bought it,” he said. “Put it on and let’s go.” It was a hideous hat. A purple velvet flap came down on one side of it and stood up on the other; the rest of it was green and looked like a cushion with the stuffing out. He decided it was less comical than jaunty and pathetic. Everything that gave her pleasure was small and depressed him.

She lifted the hat one more time and set it down slowly on top of her head. Two wings of gray hair protruded on either side of her florid face, but her eyes, sky-blue, were as innocent and untouched by experience as they must have been when she was ten. Were it not that she was a widow who had struggled fiercely to feed and clothe and put him through school and who was supporting him still, “until he got on his feet,” she might have been a little girl that he had to take to town.

“It’s all right, it’s all right,” he said. “Let’s go.” He opened the door himself and started down the walk to get her going. The sky was a dying violet and the houses stood out darkly against it, bulbous liver-colored monstrosities of a uniform ugliness though no two were alike. Since this had been a fashionable neighborhood forty years ago, his mother persisted in thinking they did well to have an apartment in it. Each house had a narrow collar of dirt around it in which sat, usually, a grubby child. Julian walked out with his hands in his pockets, his head down and thrust forward and his eyes glazed with the determination to make himself completely numb during the time he would be sacrificed to her pleasure.
