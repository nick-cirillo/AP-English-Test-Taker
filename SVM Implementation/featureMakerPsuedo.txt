Set up line-by-line iteration
For each line, add the line to totaltext
   If the line contains | (end marker)
       If i = 0 (this is the passage)
           Featurize and add to cell array on levels j:j+4
       Else if i = 1 (this is the question)
           Featurize and append to cell array on levels j:j+4
       Else if i > 1 && i < 7 (these are the answers)
           Featurize and add to cell array at level j + i
           if i = 6 (this is answer E)
	j+=5
       Endif
   i++
   totaltext = ''
